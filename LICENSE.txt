Sinter is dual-licensed under the LGPL (see LICENSE.LGPL.txt) and a commercial license.

In layman's terms, this means that anyone may use the code for free,
subject to the terms of the LGPL.  However, the authors and their
institutions (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
Stony Brook University, hereafter "the institutions"), reserve the
right to offer commercial licenses for this software, should this be
in the interest of getting the technology into the hands of more
users.  For this reason, any contributors to the project must agree to
allow the institutions to license their contributions as part of this
code base for commercial purposes.

Sinter also includes two third-party libraries, both of which have permissive licenses:
