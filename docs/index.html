				<h4>What is Sinter?</h4>
				<p>
					Sinter is an innovative
					platform for remote access
					that supports screen readers
					and other assistive software.
					Sinter is portable across
					operating systems (currently
					Mac and Windows).  For
					example, a Mac user can
					connect to a Windows remote
					desktop
					and read remote Windows apps
					using VoiceOver (the default
					screen reader for Mac OS X).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="whySinter">
				<h4>Why Sinter?</h4>
				<p>
					A large problem for users with
					visual impairments has been
					the ability to access programs
					remotely. Traditional screen
					readers are unable to process
					the elements on the remote
					application over protocols
					like RDP and VNC.
				</p>

			<div class="howSinter">
				<h4>How Does Sinter Work?</h4>
				<p>
					Sinter works by extracting the
					UI graph from the remote
					system (e.g., buttons,
					windows, menus, text boxes),
					and creating a client
					application, using similar,
					but native widgets, that
					mirrors the remote application.
					The client application's
					events (e.g., mouse clicks and
					keystrokes)
					are replayed to the remote application.
					The client application in
					sinter does not look identical
					to the remote, but is
					indistinguishable to the
					screen reader from a local application.

				<h4>When Will I Get to Use Sinter?</h4>
				<p>
					The alpha release is coming
					soon! For now, if you are
					particularly adventurous, you
					can compile the code from
					source
					at <a href="https://github.com/oscarlab/sinter">https://github.com/oscarlab/sinter</a>.
					Be aware that the software is still a work in progress and bugs may be present in the application.
