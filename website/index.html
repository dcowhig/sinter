				<h4>What is Sinter?</h4>
				<p>
					Sinter is an innovative platform that allows a user to be able to access programs on different operating systems. For example, a Windows's user can access programs on MacOS using Sinter. Sinter works by setting up a connection between a Client on the user's OS and a Server on the OS that the user is accessing a program from. Upon request, the Server will send over the elements of the program and the Client will reassemble them for the user.

				<h4>Why Sinter?</h4>
				<p>
					A large problem with programmers with visual impairments has been the ability to access programs remotely. Traditional screen readers are unable to process the elements on the remote application. With Sinter's ability to recreate the remote application, these screen readers will now be able to read those remote applications since they are now present on the user's computer.
