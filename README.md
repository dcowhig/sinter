# Sinter

* An Accessible, Cross-Platform Remote Desktop Protocol

## What is Sinter?

Sinter is an innovative platform for remote access that supports
screen readers and other assistive software.  Sinter is portable
across operating systems (currently Mac and Windows).  For example, a
Mac user can connect to a Windows remote desktop and read remote
Windows apps using VoiceOver (the default screen reader for Mac OS X).

Sinter currently supports applications including XXX.
We plan to increase this list over time.

Currently, Sinter runs as a stand-alone application on the client and
server.  We eventually plan to make Sinter a plug-in for Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other remote-desktop systems.
